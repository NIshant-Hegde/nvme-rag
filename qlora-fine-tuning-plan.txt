# QLoRA Fine-tuning Plan for NVMe RAG Project

## 1. Model Selection
- Base model: Mistral-7B (currently used in ollama_client.py)
- Rationale: Good balance of performance and resource requirements

## 2. Data Preparation
1. Extract training data from:
   - Processed NVMe spec chunks in data/processed/*.json
   - Existing Q&A pairs from test files
   - Generate synthetic Q&A pairs from spec content

2. Format requirements:
   - Input: NVMe specification context + question
   - Output: Technical answer about NVMe specifications
   - Target ~1000 high-quality training pairs

## 3. QLoRA Configuration
- Use 4-bit quantization
- Target adapters:
  - Query translation
  - Technical answer generation
- Training parameters:
  - Learning rate: 3e-4
  - Batch size: 4
  - Gradient accumulation: 4
  - Max sequence length: 2048
  - LoRA rank: 8
  - LoRA alpha: 16

## 4. Implementation Steps
1. Set up QLoRA environment:
   - Add bitsandbytes, peft, transformers requirements
   - Configure mixed precision training

2. Data processing pipeline:
   - Convert NVMe chunks to training format
   - Implement data augmentation
   - Create train/validation splits

3. Training script:
   - Implement QLoRA training loop
   - Add evaluation metrics
   - Configure model saving/loading

4. Integration:
   - Modify ollama_client.py to use fine-tuned model
   - Update qa_pipeline.py for adapter loading
   - Add inference optimization

## 5. Evaluation Metrics
- Answer accuracy on NVMe domain questions
- Technical precision of generated responses
- Response latency
- Memory usage

## 6. Resource Requirements
- GPU: At least 16GB VRAM
- Storage: ~20GB for model and training data
- Training time: Estimated 4-8 hours

## 7. Success Criteria
- Improved accuracy on NVMe-specific queries
- Reduced hallucination on technical details
- Maintained or improved inference speed
- Memory usage within production constraints
